This is where you fix that, read the error messages and bang out the kinks, and then make it pretty-ish. This is also a good time to mull over those restrictions from step 1 again. And remember, good code is DRY, so look for places you repeat or opportunities to make your code more universal, like putting it in a function."

Look at how other people solved the problem, understand each step of their process, look for how your approach differs.
